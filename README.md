VuFindHttp
==========

Introduction
------------
VuFindHttp contains a convenience class built around Laminas\Http\Client which allows
creation of proxy-aware clients and convenient GET/POST behavior. This is part of
the VuFind project (https://vufind.org) but may be useful for any software dealing
with HTTP calls.


Installation
------------
The recommended method for incorporating this library into your project is to use
Composer (http://getcomposer.org).
